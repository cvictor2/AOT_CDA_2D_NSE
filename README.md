# AOT_CDA_2D_NSE
This repository contains code for simulating mobile observers for use in data assimilation for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and the 1D Allen-Cahn equations.

The 2D NSE code is spread across a few files.
- NSE_2Dpsi_IF_Interpolants - this file is the core of the code which runs the simulations.
- DataAssimilationVariables_NSE - this file initializes the data assimilation structures
- OlsonTitiForcing - this file creates a low mode forcing to replicate the forcing present in a paper by Eric Olson and Edriss Titi
- restarts - any file with restart in the name is used to initialize the reference solution. They are generated by running a simulation out to large times that is initialized with 0.

Note: This code is set to be able to run an arbitrary amount of data assimilation trials at once. Contained in DataAssimilationVariables_NSE are commented out templates for different types of mobile observers. To run with a specified type of mobile observer copy one of the templates and move it to the top of this file (DataAssimilationVariables_NSE), after the uncommented code. Then uncomment the template and modify it however you would like. To run multiple simulations repeat this process. Each trial does require simulating NSE, so expect trials to take longer when running multiple.
